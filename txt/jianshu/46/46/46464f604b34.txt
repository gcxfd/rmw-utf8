很暖的骤冷冬夜
【今晚剧之《我，马瓦利奥》】It is a live play for us to play. But we didn't know how and the adult audience were taught by the little ones, for the children got the actor and interacted immediately. And the adults? They just went blank and didn't know what to do. Work hard and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Yes, I am one of the many Jack tonight. "We adults respect the actors so much that we forget to clear the mind to enjoy the play and have fun." Said the actor. Brain indeed gets us somewhere, but outside is far more grand where only the heart leads the way. Be aware of what you are used to.
今晚还有两个很暖的细节。这么冷的天，观众在位子上越看越冷，那演员呢？所以在结束后的沙龙，第一个问题就是“你冷吗？”而另一个带小孩的妈妈默默地卖了两杯热饮给演员和翻译，在摸到热饮的那一刻，相信他们是真的很需要也被这热度给暖到了。当然，我也被暖到了。关爱可以是无时无刻，只要心有他人。
这个剧，很值～
